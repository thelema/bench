(** The following function suffices for most uses of this library.  To
    benchmark the (unit -> unit) functions [f],[g],and [h], the
    following will run the benchmark and print a comparison: {[
    Bench.bench ["f",f; "g",g; "h",h] ]} The number of iterations to
    run per sample and number of samples to take will be computed
    automatically.  *)

(** Benchmark many unit functions. *)
val bench : (string * (unit -> 'a)) list -> unit

  (** How much the outliers affected the variance, as a percentage.
      0% means no effect, 100% means the outliers were responsible for all
      the variance. *)

val bench_funs : (string * ('a -> 'b)) list -> 'a -> results list

(** This function benchmarks functions that take a single parameter of
    how many repetitions to run.  This is slightly more accurate
    benchmark than others, as the function isn't wrapped by an
    extension function that calls it many times.  *)
val bench_n : (string * (int -> 'a)) list -> results list

(** Benchmark a function for throughput.  The function's argument is
    the block size it will work over, and the block sizes to test are
    given in a list.  The results are in terms of throughput - the
    time taken divided by the size of the block.  *)

(** The function that summarizes the results by comparing the results
    linearly.  The first parameter is the alpha (type I error rate)
    for the "same time" test, the second is the list of results from
    the tests. *)

  (** Whether or not to call [Gc.compact] between tests
      Default=false*)

  (** The number of resamples to use when computing confidence
      intervals Default=1000 *)

  mutable confidence_interval : float; 
  (** How big a confidence interval to estimate for mean and stdev Default: 95% (0.95)*)

  mutable output : (results list -> unit) list; 
  (** Output functions to use.  Default: [summarize 0.05] *)

}

(* This module's global config *)
val config : config

(** Initialize the benchmark environment by measuring the clock
   resolution and cost.  This function is called automatically if
   these measurements are needed, and calling it a second time does
   nothing. *)
